Our Game: Breakout

What is the purpose of the game?
To destroy all the blocks using the ball. 

What element(s) are controlled by the player?
The x-position of the paddle

What element(s) are controlled by the computer?
Ball speed, y-position of the paddle, bounce of the ball, direction of ball, where the blocks are.

How does the player control their element?
Move their mouse left to right.

How do the non-player controlled elements behave (movement, positions, randomness, etc)?
Ball bounces when it hits the paddle, ball speed increases as the game progresses, position of the blocks is controlled, the direction the ball bounces off the paddle is controlled. 

If you were to program this, what classes would you write?
Block, ball, and paddle classes.

If you were to program this, would you use an array for some parts? What kind of array? What would you be storing in it?
2d arrays for blocks. We'd store the blocks and put everything else(position, destroyed/not) in the class.
